        <h1 id="background">What is permissions checking? Why does it matter?</h1>
        <p>
          It’s understanding which version of your work you can deposit, where, how, and when. Depending on when you published, with which publisher, in which journal, and at which institution in which country, the answer can be quite different. Figuring this out is known as permissions checking, and it’s one of the biggest hurdles when self-archiving.
          <br>
          <br>
          While we don’t talk about it much as a community, getting it right and making it easy stands between us and a transformation in how self-archiving is done. For authors and librarians alike, permissions checking is a complex and slow task, and there aren’t enough useful tools to help digest the myriad policies in order to obtain clear answers.
        </p>

      <h1 id="howitworks">How it works</h1>
      <p>
        Information on how it works can be found on <a href="/permissions#learnmore">the homepage</a>, and more specifics, including  the schema can be found on this page. If you’d like to know more, <a href="mailto:joe@openaccessbutton.org">send us a message</a> and we’ll happily get back to you asap.
      </p>

      <h1 id="contributing">Contributing</h1>
      <p>
        There are two major ways we need the community to help, but before you do please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0_nEfBN142m-oW7t1AzVJVhh09LeYMEJsooNLIOFYpA6Byw/viewform?usp=sf_link">let us know who you are</a>. You can:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contribute individual policies—if you find that we don’t have a policy you are aware of, you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0_nEfBN142m-oW7t1AzVJVhh09LeYMEJsooNLIOFYpA6Byw/viewform?usp=sf_link">contribute it here</a>.</li>
          <li>Contribute in bulk—If you have a list of relevant policies you think we could use, we’d love to work with you to include them. <a href="mailto:Joe@openaccessbutton.org">Get in touch</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        We’ll accept contributions from anyone; however, we ask that you identify who you are and that you source your information. We recommend contributing only if you are intimately familiar with what you’re contributing, e.g., you’re a trained scholarly communications practitioner or a journal editor / publisher.
      </p>

      <!-- TODO: - I know this is a draft but maybe finding a way to tidy up a little how API docs are displayed?

      It's just the format - the spaces between the lines maybe could be a little bit shorter? and change the size of the font of the subheadings (/affiliations, /:doi /journal) could be like 1 size smaller so that you don't have to think twice that they're all parts of API docs. Apart from that I think everything is fine!

        The API provides responses as shown in the schema, but it should be easy to understand most fields without it.

        <b>Background</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Our schema and database do not directly track policies. We track permissions. Said another way, one line in our database doesn’t equate to a policy. One line is one permission. For us, a ‘permission’ is one way that self-archiving has been permitted by an institution. A policy may contain many permissions, and our database aims to capture them in a machine usable format. For example, a policy may give permission to self archiving a postprint in an institutional repository after 12 months with a certain statement and license. This is one permission. The same policy may also say you can self-archive on your personal website, immediately, without a statement or license. To describe the whole policy in a machine readable format is difficult. To describe the individual permissions in a machine readable format, and surface the appropriate permission at the appropriate time is easier. Currently, we focus on permissions to self-archive a postprint in an institutional repository.
        <br>
        <br>
        We have a shared data schema across our database and APIs, although some elements are only present in one part or the other. The schema is subject to change, both as we change it, and at short notice when publishers change their policy. In either case, efforts will be made to avoid breaking changes.
        <br>
        <br>
        The API responses, and data within it, come in a few major sections. First, at the highest level, are permissions, as discussed above. The API details an ‘authoritative_permission’, which is our best attempt at identifying an accurate and advantageous permission. We generate a response that is specific to the DOI in question in these cases. We also provide ‘all_permissions’ which details all the available permissions in their raw form. Each permission has a schema as detailed below.
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        The database is managed in a Google Sheet; it does not contain any interesting code, only  raw data that can be downloaded. You’re welcome to use the Google Sheet code and formulas currently used for the bulk checker.
      </p>

      <h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
      <p>
        We have lots of plans. Some of the highlights include:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Refine API response</li>
          <li>Including copyright ownership and deeper licensing information</li>
          <li>Getting to 100 percent coverage of publisher policies for journal articles. We’re working down the list of publishers while exploring a data-driven approach to this task.</li>
          <li>Interfaces allowing authors and libraries to obtain more information on a one-by-one basis in Shareyourpaper.org.</li>
          <li>Improving data coverage for conference proceedings and preprints.</li>
          <li>Considering expanding the data schema where you can post, and providing terms for depositing in subject repositories and on author websites.</li>
          <li>Streamlining querying even in the absence of a DOI, or with a Datacite DOI.</li>
        </ul>
