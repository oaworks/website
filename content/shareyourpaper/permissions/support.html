        For Libraries: You’ve got a lot to do—let us help you scratch permissions checking off the list.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Doing permissions checking for authors is an excellent way to fill your repository and help advance Open Access. That’s why we built free tools that take a lot of the work out of permissions checking.
        <br>
        <br>
        In order to further support libraries having world-class, cost-efficient permissions checking workflows, our training and support package ensures that you understand what the tools are doing, why, and that you are prepared for every eventuality. Better yet, this paid-for option means you’ll be financially supporting the tools so that they can continue to be free for everyone.

        For Publishers: Writing a good self-archiving policy is hard, but we can help make it easy.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Increase your journal’s citation rate and show you’re on your scholars’ side with a clear and simple self-archiving policy giving scholars the right to share their work. We can help you do this and to differentiate yourself as authors, libraries, and research funders are increasingly seeking a more open approach to scholarship.
        <br>
        <br>
        As one of the leading providers of systems that compile and comply with self-archiving policies, we’ve read and analysed hundreds of self-archiving policies, including yours!

            <li>Expert and community review of your current or draft policy, with clear suggestions for improvement.</li>
            <li>Making it easy for authors, and those depositing on your behalf, to follow your policy.</li>
            <li>Understanding how your policy differs from that of your peers.</li>

      <p>
        We never thought we’d say this, but we love talking about permissions checking. So, if you’re a funder, researcher, or anyone who wants to do something interesting with self-archiving, we’d love to see how we can help.
