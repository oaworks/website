<h1>Major Updates for the Open Access Button and Open Data Button </h1>


<p>We're excited to say this week we'll release major updates for the Open Access Button and the Open Data Button for Firefox.</p>

<p>

<p>Updated plug-ins for the Open Access Button will now have more ways to find access to research. First, we've integrated with with <a href = "https://www.base-search.net/about/en/" target="_blank">BASE</a>. Base indexes over 5.5 million Open Access articles, primarily from repositories. BASE joins CORE, as services the Open Access Button can now use to find access to articles behind a paywall. Second, the plugin supports our "email the author" and request systems. To support these systems we've integrated with <a href = "http://dissem.in/" target="_blank">Dissem.in</a> and Zenodo. Papers obtained through the system will be deposited through <a href = "http://dissem.in/" target="_blank">Dissem.in</a> and <a href = "https://zenodo.org/" target="_blank">Zenodo</a>.</p>

<p>

<p>Along with these new features, the map and stories from the Open Access Button beta will return, and both the map and user stories will now be embeddable and searchable.</p>

<p>

<p>Finally, we've made several bug fixes within this update, including a better sign-in experience for users and how the plug-in identifies papers on publisher websites.</p>

<p>

<p>Both the updated Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox plug-ins for the Open Access Button will be released this week. This release will improvethe Open Access Button's usability, ability to find access to research for users, and enable users to request access to more research.</p>

<p>

<p>Joining this update will be the Open Data Button's release on Firefox.</p>

<p>In addition to the plug-in updates, we'll be updating our websites. This website update will impact use of the Open Access Button. Requests links may result in errors on Tuesday and Wednesday while the domain changes. We apologise if you experience any errors during this transition - but hold tight, weâre bringing you a better Button. </p>

<p>We'd like to thank the Open Society Foundation, the Center for Open Science and others for supporting this work. </p>
