<p>Thank you for your interest in the Open Access Button. Signing a letter of interest helps us demonstrate formal support for our mission to funders, other libraries, and most importantly... ourselves!</p>

<p>Please ensure the letter is signed on behalf of a relavent department (e.g document delivery), or the whole library, with the latter being preferable. Upon signing, we'll send a confirmation email to those mentioned to verify the signing.</p>

  <p>Dear SPARC,</p>

  <p>I’m writing to express my deep interest in and support for the Open Access Button, a suite of tools enabling fast, easy discovery and requesting of scholarly outputs. In particular, we support the Open Access Button developing high-quality services for our library aimed at:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>improving the usability (for patrons and staff), cost-effectiveness, and efficacy of “just in-time” (e.g Interlibrary Loan & purchase-on-demand) services,</li>
      <li>strengthening libraries big deal negotiation positions and lowering requirements for journal subscriptions,</li>
  adapting existing service paradigms, such as Interlibrary Loan, for use in facilitating data and code sharing, and content mining,</li>
      <li>increasing the use, reuse, and creation of Open content,</li>
      <li>enabling investments in campus-level library services to serve broader communities and more strongly align with missions to democratize access to knowledge.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>This project has the potential to create an important piece of infrastructure for libraries— one that is owned by the library community and not at risk of enclosure by a for-profit vendor. These services could help reduce library’s costs while promoting an open scholarly infrastructure and allowing libraries to better serve their users.</p>

  <p>Our library would be happy to provide the Open Access Button team with feedback on functionality, consider piloting, and adoption of resulting services.</p>
